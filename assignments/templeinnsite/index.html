    <h2>Welcome to Temple Inn & Suites!</h2>

    <p>Since 2019, Temple Inn & Suites has provided many temple patrons
        with quality, affordable housing for their temple stays. For many people
        who want to attend the temple, the trip can take many days, and man miles. And
        once they do make it, they cannot afford a standard hotel. That is where we come in.
        Those who are traveling from very far away can book a great hotel that 
        costs significantly less than normal hotels. we hope you enjoy using our 
        site, and may your temple experiance be holy and divine!
    </p>

    <h3>About Us</h3>

    <p>
        Temple Inn & Suites was founded on April 10th, 2019, by Robert
        Willardson. Robert has been a member all of his life, and was raised in rural
        Utah. As such, he always had a temple no less than one mile away from 
        his home. One day he was reading in the scriptures about temple service, when
        the sadding thought came to him that many faithful latter-day saints
        have to travel many miles to go to the temple; some may only ever 
        go once, to recieve their own ordiances. So, Robert decided to
        do something about it, and now we have the Temple Inn & Suites corporation.
